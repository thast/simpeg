Magnetics
*********


The geomagnetic field can be ranked as the longest studied of all the geophysical properties of the earth. In addition, the magnetic survey has been used broadly in diverse realms e.g., mining, oil and gas, industry and environmental engineering. Although this geophysical application is quite common in geoscience; we do not have modular, well-documented and well-tested open-source codes, which perform forward and inverse problems of a magnetic survey. Therefore, here we are going to build up magnetic forward and inverse modeling code based on two common methodologies for the forward problem - differential equation and integral equation approaches. \

First, we start with some backgrounds of magnetics, e.g., Maxwell's equations. Secondly, we use the differential equation approach to solve the forward problem with a secondary field formulation. In order to discretzie our system here, we use finite volume approach with weak formulation. Third, we solve the inverse problem through the Gauss-Newton method.

Backgrounds
===========
Maxwell's equations for static case with out current source can be written as

.. math::

    \nabla U = \frac{1}{\mu}\vec{B} \\

    \nabla \cdot \vec{B} = 0

where \\(\\vec{B}\\) is magnetic flux (\\(\T\\)) and \\(\U\\) is magnetic potential and \\(\\mu\\) is permeability. Since we do not have any source terms in above equations, the boundary condition is going to be the driving force of our system as given below

.. math::

    (\vec{B}\cdot{\vec{n}})_{\partial\Omega} = B_{BC}

where \\(\\vec{n}\\) means the unit normal vector on the boundary surface (\\(\\partial \\Omega\\)). By using a secondary field formulation we can rewrite above equations as

.. math::

    \frac{1}{\mu}\vec{B}_s = (\frac{1}{\mu}_0-\frac{1}{\mu})\vec{B}_0+\nabla\phi_s

    \nabla \cdot \vec{B}_s = 0

    (\vec{B}_s\cdot{\vec{n}})_{\partial\Omega} = B_{sBC}

where \\(\\vec{B}_s\\) is the secondary magnetic flux and \\(\\vec{B}_0\\) is the background or primary magnetic flux. In practice, we consider our earth field, obtained from the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) by specifying the time and location, as  \\(\\vec{B}_0\\). Based on this background fields we compute secondary fields (\\(\\vec{B}_s\\)). Now we introduce the susceptibility as

.. math::

    \chi = \frac{\mu}{\mu_0} - 1 \\

    \mu = \mu_0(1+\chi)

Since most materials in the earth  have lower permeability than \\(\\mu_0\\), usually \\(\\chi\\) is greater than 0.

.. note::

    Actually, this is an assumption, which means we are not sure exactly this is true, although we are sure it is very rare that we can encounter those materials. Anyway, practical range of the susceptibility is \\(0 < \\chi < 1 \\).

Since we compute the secondary field based on the earth field, which can be different from different locations in the world, we can expect different anomalous responses in different locations in the earth. For instance, assume we have two susceptible spheres, which are exactly same. Anomalous responses in Seoul and Vancouver are going to be different.

Since we can measure total fields ( \\(\\vec{B}\\)), and usually have a reasonably accurate earth field (\\(\\vec{B}_0\\)), we can compute anomalous fields, \\(\\vec{B}_s\\) from our observed data. If you want to download earth magnetic fields at specific locations see this website (`noaa <https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag-web/>`_).

What is our data?
-----------------

In applied geophysics, which means in practice, it is common to refer to measurements as "the magnetic anomaly" and we can consider this as our observed data. For further descriptions in `GPG <http://gpg.geosci.xyz/>`_ materials for magnetic surveys. Now we have the simple relationship between "the magnetic anomaly" and the total field as

.. math::

	\triangle\vec{B} = |\hat{B}_o-\vec{B}_s|-|\hat{B}_o| \approx |\vec{B}_s|cos \theta

where \\(\\theta\\) is the angle between total and anomalous fields, \\(\\hat{B}_o\\) is the unit vector for \\(\\vec{B}_o\\). Equivalently, we can use the vector dot product to show that the anomalous field is approximately equal to the projection of that field onto the direction of the inducing field. Using this approach we would write

.. math::

	\triangle\vec{B} = |\vec{B}_s|cos \theta = |\hat{B}_o||\vec{B}_s|cos \theta = \hat{B}_o \cdot \vec{B}_s

This is important because in practice we usually use a total field magnetometer (like a proton precession or optically pumped sensor), which can measure only that part of the anomalous field which is in the direction of the earth's main field.

    .. math::

        \mathbf{A}\mathbf{u} = \mathbf{rhs}

        \mathbf{A} =  \Div(\MfMui)^{-1}\Div^{T}

        \mathbf{rhs} =  \Div(\MfMui)^{-1}\mathbf{M}^f_{\mu_0^{-1}}\mathbf{B}_0 - \Div\mathbf{B}_0+\diag(v)\mathbf{D} \mathbf{P}_{out}^T \mathbf{B}_{sBC}

        \mathbf{B}_s = (\MfMui)^{-1}\mathbf{M}^f_{\mu_0^{-1}}\mathbf{B}_0-\mathbf{B}_0 -(\MfMui)^{-1}\Div^T \mathbf{u}
